*1* Bedrooms:
5 category, 1 to 5,
unbalanced categories

I believe no outlier exist

*2* Bathrooms:
quite similar to Bedrooms
5 categories, 1 to 5
unbalanced categories
missing values: 238
I believe no outlier exist

*3* SquareFootageHouse
float data
contains outliers
no missing value

*4* Location
- a missplelling reformed: Suburban Suburbann
6 missing values
balanced labels

*5* Age
158 missing values
contains outlier

*6* PoolQuality
Missing variables are meant to be no-pool, but what about the variables that are really missing?
272 Non value
clearly a new label should be added but it seems that setting all values to no-pool is not ideal


*7* HasPhotovoltaics
-replace true false with 0 1
246 missing values

*8* HeatingType
No missing value
-changing Electric to Electricity
-changing Oil Heating to Oil
seems fine now
